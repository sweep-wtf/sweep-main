# Purpose

Sweep is an advanced, non-custodial Solana wallet optimization tool. It identifies and clears unwanted dust tokens, executes optimized swaps, and reinvests recovered value using AI-driven strategies. Sweep is built for both casual and power users who want maximum efficiency from their Solana wallets.

---

## Overview

Sweep was created to solve the growing problem of token clutter on the Solana network. Many wallets accumulate low-value tokens that hold little or no market value, creating inefficiencies. Sweep removes these tokens, converts them to SOL, and optionally reinvests the proceeds based on user-defined strategies or AI-generated insights.

Key design principles:
- **Performance:** Built on Solana for speed and scalability.
- **Security:** 100% non-custodial with audited smart contracts.
- **Automation:** Minimal user input required; Sweep handles optimization seamlessly.
- **Transparency:** All operations are visible and verifiable on-chain.

## Features

- Automated detection and clearing of dust tokens.
- Intelligent swap and burn mechanisms for maximum recovery.
- AI-powered reinvestment strategies tailored to user behavior.
- Portfolio analytics and detailed wallet reports.
- Support for multiple wallets with a single interface.
- Real-time market integration for accurate pricing and trading routes.
